<h2> His Early Life </h2>
    <p> Albert Einstein was born in Germany in 1789 to Hermann and Pauline.  He grew up in a secular Jewish family.  He grew up with one sister, named Maja.  He attended elementary school in Munich.  He also had speech challenges.  He then had begun developing a passion for classical music and violin playing.  When he was a little bit older he had a tutor who introduced him to new sciences that inspired Einstein.  As a result, he wrote his first major paper in his teen years about the magnetic fields. </p>
